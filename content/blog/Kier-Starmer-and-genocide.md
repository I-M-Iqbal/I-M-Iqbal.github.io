In October 2023, Nick Ferrari asked the Prime Minister whether a siege and cutting off water and electricity supplies to Gaza (which was already subject to an unlawful blockade)[^1] was a proportionate response to October 7? He responded by saying:

> 'I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation, obviously everything should be done within international law but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has the right to defend herself'[^2]

In 2024 in parliament he said  he was 'well aware of the definition of genocide' and that this explains why he has 'never described or referred to [the situation in Gaza] as genocide'.[^3]

On the 24th July 2025, the Prime Minister Sir Kier Starmer KCB KC, made the following statement:

> 'The suffering and starvation unfolding in Gaza is unspeakable and indefensible. While the situation has been grave for some time, it has reached new depths and continues to worsen. We are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe.... We all agree on the pressing need for Israel to change course and allow the aid that is desperately needed to enter Gaza without delay.'[^4]

What is noteable is that he still refuses to condemn what Israel is doing, depriving the population of food, as a violation of International Law, as potentially the crime of genocide. 

In 2014 the prime minister when he was a mere human rights lawyer represented Croatia before the ICJ. The case is titled: Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia).[^5]

## Why did Croatia bring a case against Serbia under the Genocide Convention?
