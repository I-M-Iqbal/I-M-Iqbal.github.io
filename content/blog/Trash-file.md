[^21]: The role of political discretion in counter terrorism law is widely discussed. For example, S.40 of the British Nationality Act (BNA) 1981 gives the Home Secretary the power to deprive persons of their citizenship status, which has most often been used on Muslims as highlighted by Dr McNeil-Willson, is discretionary. The Home Secretary does not have to deprive, in fact there are many people who travelled to ISIL territory who returned to the UK, rather it is within their discretion. See https://imiqbal.com/what-is-siac/ for more on S.40 of the BNA. 


## Why was a member of Kneecap charged with supporting a proscribed organisations:

A member of Kneecap whose stage name is Mo Chara, has been charged with supporting a proscribed organisation. He was charged

In May, Chara was charged in relation to a video from Kneecap’s November 2024 concert at O2 Kentish Town Forum, London. In the clip, Mo Chara can be heard seemingly shouting, “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” He is also charged for waving a Hezbollah flag. 

Neither of those acts are direct support for Hezbollah or Hamas, they are if proven, rhetorical support for the groups actions. So how are they criminal offences?

## Definition of supporting a proscribed organisation:

The answer: The definition of the offences known as supporting a proscribed organisation is broad. Very Broad. 

The UK government intend to use S.3 of the Terrorism Act to make Palestine Actions direct action unlawful in the future because they recently broke into an RAF base to protest the UK governments role in supporting Israel's war in Gaza.[^2] 

Palestine Action is a direct action group whose activities are protests, not acts that we traditionally think of as acts of as terrorism. Civil disobedience as a form of protest has a long history. 

The suffragettes engaged in civil disobidence such as the rush on Parliament in October 1908 when it encouraged the public to join them in an attempt to invade the House of Commons and other attacks on property.[^12] They also planted bombs in Westminster Abby.[^13]

The Labour Peer Lord Peter Hain, who was a leading anti-apartheid campaigner in the UK and who led the direct action protests that disrupted South African rugby and cricket tours in 1969 and 1970 and was spied on by police for his activities highlighted that his actions would lead to him being vilified as a Terrorist.[^14]

### Example 2: potential proscription of Palestine Action: 

With regard to the potential proscription of Palestine Action, they are most famous for breaking into arms factories that produce arms that are being sent to Israel, who are using them to in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and for throwing red paint at organisations such as Barclays who have financial ties to arms companies who sell weapons to Israel.[^14]

Regardless of whether you agree with their actions, proscribing protest groups thereby making it illegal to participate in their protests, wear symbols associated with them or express support for the forms of direct action they take, as a person might believe you are encouraging support for them, is an extreme step for a democratic state to take. Amnesty UK has highlighted the risks to the right to protest posed by this ban.[^15]

Perhaps the reason for proscription is to allow the proscribed organisation offences to apply to Palestine Action's protests. In previous trials for criminal damage, juries have acquitted members of Palestine Action because they argued that 'their actions were justified on the basis of necessity, in order to save the lives of Palestinians, and in order to protect property at immediate risk of drone bombardment in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT)'.[^16] Given the nature of the proscribed organisation offences, this defence is unlikely to be effective. 

Their most recent protest, breaking into an RAF base and spraying red paint on a plane in protest, might arguably affect the military activities which is clearly a national defence concern, although a small one and proscription appears to be a disproportionate response, even if one finds this argument compelling. Given that protests near to military bases have happened before,[^17], and many Anti South African Apartheid protests took the form of direct action and were not treated as a security threat,[^18] this decision by the government seems questionable.

##  Some groups were committing acts that violated S.3 long before they were proscribed. So why were they proscribed at the point they were?

The answer is discretion yet again. 

For example the Wagner group was proscribed in 2023 because of its activities supporting Russians invasion of Ukraine, but it has been committing actions that technically violate S.3 for years previously in Africa and the Middle East,[^7] so why only take the decision in 2023? 

Answer: the Home Secretary only deemed it necessary in 2023, as their actions in Ukraine posed a more direct threat to the UK than actions they had previously undertaken. It was also an additional way to support Ukraine which might be the underlying political motivation for using the power in 2023.[^7]




A further blog post about these offences, focusing on the offence that Mr Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, better known as Mo Chara of Kneecap, has been changed with is also likely to be written in the near future. This will include discussion of the extraterritoriality of some of these offences.[^11] (extraterritoriality = someone can be prosecuted for the offence even if it was committed abroad. Criminal jurisdiction is normally not extraterritorial so this is unusual)

One example of groups that are proscribed is the UK Hamas. 

Hamas aims to 'liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation and establish an Islamic state in Palestine'.[^9] It was proscribed because it 'commits and participates in terrorism' because it has amongst other things 'launched indiscriminate rocket and mortar attacks' on Israel.[^9] It also prepares for terrorism by training young persons to participate in these attacks[^9]. 

Hamas launched a legal challenge to its proscription recently which has yet to be adjudicated.[^10]. There is likely to be a further blog post about the court that hears cases challenging proscription and the arguments being made by Hamas in the future.

This might appear confusing, why is a group that has not carried out any attacks on the UK on this list? Perhaps because the Home Secretary can proscribe organisations to support our allies in the War on Terror? This might be true, but given the broad meaning of concerned with terrorism and the extra territoriality of the UK definition of Terrorism and other terrorism offences, the groups activities appear to fit under the S.3 power to proscribe. These issues are discussed further below. 



The Wagner group is a, 'Russian private military company which has acted as a malign proxy military force on behalf of the Russian state'.[^7] The reason its designation as proscribed is strange because it was only proscribed after the most recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, despite operating and committing human rights abuses in Africa for nearly a decade.[^12] Those human rights abuses include the serious violence against people and property to advance a political cause, that cause being increasing Russian influence in certain regions of Africa and the Middle east including Libya and Syria, which are the very reasons it was proscribed in 2023. Those actions do fit under the definition of being concerned with terrorism in S.3 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which raises questions about why they were only proscribed in 2023, when their actions before then, also could lead to proscription. The answer is that the Home Secretary did not deem their actions as warranting proscription before 2023. But why?  

In general, it does not appear they were proscribed because they pose a direct threat to the UK in the way other groups on the list would (like ISIL)[^7], there is little chance of people committing attacks in the UK in support of Wagner nor is there alot of change of people expressing support for Wagner in the UK in such a way that it would assit them in Ukraine.[^13] Essentially, their activities don't seem to fit with the activities of other groups on the proscribed organisation list. 

It appears this was an action taken to support Ukraine, which is understandable as it is an aim of UK foreign and defence policy.[^14] But ordinarily, state affiliated threats are dealt with via other areas of law rather than terrorism law.[^15] 

This highlights one of the key problems with the breadth of S.3: it can cover activities which better fit under other areas of the law. This leaves the Home Secretary with the choice as to deal with groups like Wagner under terrorism law or other forms of law that target state entities. 

Another reason why Wagner may have been proscribed is because the offences of supporting a proscribed organisation are broader and extra territorial which could make prosecuting persons who support them easier.[^15] 

relevant footnote: https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/wagner-group-supporter-jailed-terrorist-offences is about a man convicted of wearing combat clothing with a Wagner insignia. He also appeared supportive of the far right and aggressively threatened people with a knife. I personally am unsure whether he would have been prosecuted for merely wearing a symbol associated with Wagner, even though that alone could violate one of the proscribed organisation offences.
