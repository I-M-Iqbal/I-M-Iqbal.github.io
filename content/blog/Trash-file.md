One example of groups that are proscribed is the UK Hamas. 

Hamas aims to 'liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation and establish an Islamic state in Palestine'.[^9] It was proscribed because it 'commits and participates in terrorism' because it has amongst other things 'launched indiscriminate rocket and mortar attacks' on Israel.[^9] It also prepares for terrorism by training young persons to participate in these attacks[^9]. 

Hamas launched a legal challenge to its proscription recently which has yet to be adjudicated.[^10]. There is likely to be a further blog post about the court that hears cases challenging proscription and the arguments being made by Hamas in the future.

This might appear confusing, why is a group that has not carried out any attacks on the UK on this list? Perhaps because the Home Secretary can proscribe organisations to support our allies in the War on Terror? This might be true, but given the broad meaning of concerned with terrorism and the extra territoriality of the UK definition of Terrorism and other terrorism offences, the groups activities appear to fit under the S.3 power to proscribe. These issues are discussed further below. 



The Wagner group is a, 'Russian private military company which has acted as a malign proxy military force on behalf of the Russian state'.[^7] The reason its designation as proscribed is strange because it was only proscribed after the most recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, despite operating and committing human rights abuses in Africa for nearly a decade.[^12] Those human rights abuses include the serious violence against people and property to advance a political cause, that cause being increasing Russian influence in certain regions of Africa and the Middle east including Libya and Syria, which are the very reasons it was proscribed in 2023. Those actions do fit under the definition of being concerned with terrorism in S.3 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which raises questions about why they were only proscribed in 2023, when their actions before then, also could lead to proscription. The answer is that the Home Secretary did not deem their actions as warranting proscription before 2023. But why?  

In general, it does not appear they were proscribed because they pose a direct threat to the UK in the way other groups on the list would (like ISIL)[^7], there is little chance of people committing attacks in the UK in support of Wagner nor is there alot of change of people expressing support for Wagner in the UK in such a way that it would assit them in Ukraine.[^13] Essentially, their activities don't seem to fit with the activities of other groups on the proscribed organisation list. 

It appears this was an action taken to support Ukraine, which is understandable as it is an aim of UK foreign and defence policy.[^14] But ordinarily, state affiliated threats are dealt with via other areas of law rather than terrorism law.[^15] 

This highlights one of the key problems with the breadth of S.3: it can cover activities which better fit under other areas of the law. This leaves the Home Secretary with the choice as to deal with groups like Wagner under terrorism law or other forms of law that target state entities. 

Another reason why Wagner may have been proscribed is because the offences of supporting a proscribed organisation are broader and extra territorial which could make prosecuting persons who support them easier.[^15] 

relevant footnote: https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/wagner-group-supporter-jailed-terrorist-offences is about a man convicted of wearing combat clothing with a Wagner insignia. He also appeared supportive of the far right and aggressively threatened people with a knife. I personally am unsure whether he would have been prosecuted for merely wearing a symbol associated with Wagner, even though that alone could violate one of the proscribed organisation offences.
