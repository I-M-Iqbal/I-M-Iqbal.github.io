+++

On the 5th of February 2026, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed in 2010 by the US and Russia (known as the New START treaty) will expire.[^1] This treaty is the successor to a series of treaties signed by the US and the USSR which aimed to control the deployment of nuclear weapons.[^1] With its expiration, there is no longer a single bilateral arms control agreement between Russia and the US, which had led to fears of a new nuclear arms race.

In 1994, the General Assembly (UNGA) adopted an resolution that requested an advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. The following is the text of the relevant section of that resolution[^2]: 

"The General Assembly, conscious that the the continuing existence and development of nuclear weapons pose serious risks to humanity, mindful that States have an obligation under the Charter of the United Nations to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State" with reference to several past resolutions of the General Assembly which are discussed in the section below which declared that the use of nuclear weapons would violate the UN Charter and be a crime against humanity, in light of progress, with regard to prohibition and elimination of other weapons of mass destruction, with reference to other conferences that have taken place about nuclear weapons and relevant international agreements, asks the following question for the ICJ to answer "Is the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstance permitted under international law?"

This blog post discusses the response to the ICJ to that question in light of the fact that the opinion is likely to become more relevant in the current era, where progress regarding nuclear de-proliferation negotiations may begin to be reversed, despite that the "serious risk to humanity" that such weapons pose.[^2]
