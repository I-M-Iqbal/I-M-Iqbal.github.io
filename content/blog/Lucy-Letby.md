Panorama Aug 2025:

Main causes of death:
- air embolism
- overfeeding
- air in stomach
- Trauma
- Insulin injection 
- Dislodging breathing tubes

International panel associated with her lawyer McDonald believe causes of death = natural or medical negligence which McDoland argues means there were no homocides meaning she is factually innocent. 

Prosecutors main expert = Evans got involved due to press reporting, professional expert and retired Doctor. He believed cause of death was homocide before the pathologist, police and treating physicians did. Evans did highlight some Dr's/ nurses who agreed with him. 

Dr Hall (original defence expert): claims jury was not givne accurate info on the state of the babies health before their collapse such as some babies has signed of being unwell prior to their collapse. 

Thirwall inquiry is investigating hospitals and takes Letby's guilt as a fact.

Baby C: Died at 4 months, Letby was alone with them. Dr Hall argued that medically incompetent aid was given. Cause of death = air in stomach which was present on an x ray which makes breathing in difficult. Problem is x ray was 41 hours before collapse and Letby was not on duty at that stage. Evans changed his mind about baby C: Initial report = no clue, witness box = air injection in my stomach but on Cross claimed intravenous air was a possibility.  Prosecutor explained this to the jury and said they could discount Evans's evidence about baby C. Post trial Evans continued to believe it was an air embolism. McDonald points out that this is a credibility issue regarding Evans. Evans stated it was inflicted injury and the exact cause does not matter. [erm this conclusion by Evans is dubious]

Dr Hall believes the decision by the original defence lawyer not to call defence experts was unfair. 

Evans claims the international panel and McDonald is wrong. Hall says panel report may be problematic: 

Example 1 baby A: Panel claims a blood clot in the artery that supplies blood to the brain, due to a maternal hereditary condition. Evans stated there was no evidence of this in the autopsy and the panel's claim that this was ignored was unrealistic. Hall stated the mothers condition was explored at trial and the jury was given that as an alternative explaination and they rejected. 

Example 2: Baby I: Panel claimed that he had a bug. Hall stated they found the bug 6 weeks prior and in the autopsy therefore was not a significant cause of death. Hall claimed McDonald's approach may rebound and undermine his aim. McDonald rejected this and he said the panel were better experts than Hall & others involved in the trial. [mention expert battle stuff here] 

Air Embolism cases = 6/7 murder cases. All babies were stable, collapsed suddenly and all had air in placed they shouldn't according to the CPS. CPS relied on a paper by Lee And Tanswell on air embolism in babies had a rash and some of the babies in this case had rashes. Lee is on the international panel and stated that skin discolouration does not mean an air embolism was cause of death. Panel claimed more plausible explanations existed. Guilt on 1 offense = evidence for others which is normal according to KV. [ugh] 

the 3 strongest verdicts were the following:

1- Baby O = partial cause of death was liver injury caused by assault according to Dr Bohi (CPS). Pathologist found blood under surface of liver. Independent panorama pathologist said the location of bleeding is indicative of other causes not trauma. McDonald panel said baby 0 died of a botched resuscitation led to a needle being inserted into the liver. The Dr responsible was one of the first to suspect Letby. He had no comment when asked about this. Jury did reject this conclusion as pathologist at trial said there was no evidence the injury happened during resus. Panorma expert agrees that this was not a needle injury because there were injuries to multiple parts of the liver. The needle also does not explain initial collapse leading to resus or why it caused death. Evans says this is not relevant to collapse. Taylor now claims needle sped up the death and his view is based on x2 unpaid defence experts [causation]. Dr Neil Aiton said there was lots of air in lungs due to resus and pushed liver into a position where it could be damaged by the needle. Aiton concluded it could have been needle or other parts of resus. Third theory = traumatic birth, which is what the panel believed caused the injury. Dr Hall disagrees by pointing out that the baby was born via C section and in good condition and claims this is a big problem for the report. Panel, even after seeing Halls opinion, state that their  explanation of plausible. 

2- Insulin babies= strongest evidence of guilt. Evidence - blood sample. Natural insulin leads to a C peptide level of 5x of 10x higher. unaffiliated expert John Gregory (prof) said no C peptide = insulin came from outside their bodies. [test faultiness]. The babies had low blood sugar, high insulin and low C peptide. The ratios between insulin and C peptide. Panel claimed test was unreliable and should ave been confirmed by other tests (Dr Ismail claimed it has the highest error rate of all tests) [is this true?]. Dr Ismail used this test often but he did emphasises not using the test results alone. Panel also claimed that pre-mature babies c peptide levels may not be the same as everyone else's. Panel relies on a report by Prof Chase who claims that pre term babies have antibodies that can bind to insulin and store it. Language of the panel is not great in Chase's view. not sharing research that proves it- McDonald. The jury verdict was fastest for these cases. 

Now for the witness issues. Baby K re-trial. Asian Dr found Letby alone with baby k whose breathing tube was out and she was not doing anything to help. Email from him says the opposite and that she alerted him about the babies low oxygen. He is a key witness. Issue is this is not new evidence, Letby did not raise this at her legitimate appeal. [incompetence]

3 managers have been arrested for gross negligent manslaughter. There is also further investigations into her actions in Liverpool. File is with the CPS. The Thirwall inquiry found 40% of the breathing tube issues took place when Letby was on shift but 1% of other cases. [This aint admissible] and McDonald rejects this. [SIDS cases and stats]
