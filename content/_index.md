Hi all, 

Thank you for taking the time to come to the tiny corner of the internet where I write about legal topics- mostly. 

There is also an archive section of the website where blog posts that are out of date can be found. 

A bit about me: I have studied law at university. As a result I have spent a lot of time thinking about the law and if and when I have coherent thoughts which might be vaguely interesting to someone other than me, they will appear here from time to time. 

Regards

I M Iqbal
