Hi all, 

Thank you for taking the time to come to the tiny corner of the internet where I write about legal topics mostly (you might get the occasional book related post too but I promise it will be related to law somehow). 

A bit about me: I have completed an undergrad degree in law and an in the process of completing a masters degree in law. As a result I have spent alot of time thinking about the law both at university and in my day to day life. If and when I have coherent thoughts which might be vaugely interesting to someone other than me, they will appear here from time to time. 

Regards

I M Iqbal
